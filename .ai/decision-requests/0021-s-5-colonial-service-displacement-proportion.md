# Decision Request: S-5 colonial-service displacement proportion

## Status

Blocked pending owner decision.

## Trigger

R4 fits a design for colonial service, which "takes up a proportion of displacement" (p.42). The proportion is not supplied. It is a ship-design value that changes design arithmetic (weights, costs), not only presence.

## Evidence

- Manual p.42: "Equipping a ship for colonial service takes up a proportion of displacement, which simulates increased marine contingent, storage spaces and other facilities useful for extended service on foreign stations."
- Manual p.130: the colonial gunboat is "a corvette with 1500 tons displacement or so" - a size hint, not a proportion.
- Repo: no colonial-service proportion is present in `docs/research/rtw-designer-parity-values.md` or in the content schema.
- Research note: `docs/research/s-5-presence-and-base-limits.md` (provenance table; manual quotations and pages).
- Prior art: ADR-0210, ADR-0213, ADR-0223, ADR-0226, ADR-0239; decision requests 0007 and 0012.
- Spec #73 (R14), ticket #75.

## Why agent judgment is insufficient

Different choices change who is penalised, when, and by how much, and so every S-5 authoritative outcome and (once authored) the golden hashes. The manual is silent, ADR-0210 forbids inventing values as fact, and the S-5 spec (#73, Decision J, R14) returns each such value to the owner. Routine local design choice does not cover a gameplay balance number.

## Options

### Option A: Owner supplies the value

- Behavior: the owner provides the proportion (basis points of design displacement) and whether it scales by ship type or size class, with provenance (a manual page, another high-trust source, or a stated design intent).
- Advantages: authoritative and unambiguous.
- Risks: the owner may not hold the original data; the value may not exist in the source game.
- Compatibility impact: none until authored.
- Migration impact: none (no prior state).
- Scope and effort: authoring ticket plus an ADR if the choice is a divergence.

### Option B: Keep the value dormant

- Behavior: the proportion (colonial service stays unavailable in the designer, so R4 and the `c` marker are not enabled in production) stays absent; the S-5 ruleset section remains dormant or (if partially authored) the compile rejects it, so no production behaviour depends on it. Projection reports 'not configured'.
- Advantages: no unsourced value ships; mechanics stay complete and tested with fixtures.
- Risks: S-5 produces no production effect; the dependent value-bearing tickets stay blocked.
- Compatibility impact: none.
- Migration impact: none.
- Scope and effort: none.

### Option C: Admit as ADR-0213 `balance_adjustment`

- Behavior: the owner explicitly waives RTW3 fidelity for this value and admits an owner-chosen number as a labelled `balance_adjustment` ruleset constant with a recorded rationale (pattern of ADR-0223 and ADR-0239), never classed as `manual`. The owner picks a single flat proportion as a balance choice.
- Advantages: unblocks the dependent S-5 tickets while remaining honest about provenance.
- Risks: a deliberate divergence from the manual; the value must be tuned by the balance sweep.
- Compatibility impact: none until authored; authoring is the one change that moves production behaviour and goldens (R14).
- Migration impact: one deliberate same-commit golden re-pin when authored.
- Scope and effort: one ADR and the authoring ticket.

## Recommendation

Option A or C. If Option B, the colonial multiplier of 1.5 cannot affect production presence, because no production ship could carry the fitting. Do not implement, author or default any of these values before the owner chooses.

## Work safely completed while blocked

- The research note `docs/research/s-5-presence-and-base-limits.md` with the provenance table.
- Mechanics in the S-5 tickets can be built and tested against labelled fixture-class rulesets; the optional ruleset section stays dormant (R11), so no production behaviour or golden changes.
