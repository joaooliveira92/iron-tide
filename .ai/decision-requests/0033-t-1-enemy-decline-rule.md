# Decision Request: T-1 enemy-decline rule (G6)

## Status

Resolved (2026-10-21) by owner delegation: **Option C**, recorded as
[ADR-0254](../../docs/adr/ADR-0254-t1-battle-offer-values-balance-targets.md). The
value is a labelled `BALANCE_TARGET`; ticket #118 is no longer blocked on it.

## Trigger

R11 needs a force-balance predicate, a threshold, a probability and any enemy cost. The manual gives only the qualitative rule. The four sub-values form one coupled group because the predicate threshold and the chance are meaningful only together.

## Evidence

- Manual p.67: "There is a chance that the enemy will decline battle if they are feeling that they cannot send out a force with reasonable chances of victory."
- No page defines "reasonable chances", a comparison, a probability, or a cost to the enemy.
- Research note: `docs/research/t-1-battle-offer-values.md` (provenance table, verbatim quotations).
- Spec #109 (R2), ticket #110; map #96 and decision tickets #97-#108.
- Prior art: ADR-0210, ADR-0213, ADR-0223, ADR-0226, ADR-0239; decision requests 0003, 0006, 0007, 0012.

## Why agent judgment is insufficient

The rule decides how often the player is denied a battle and whether the AI avoids obvious losses; a draw adds a recorded stream. Provenance class: STRUCTURE ONLY; all values UNSOURCED. The manual is silent, ADR-0210 forbids inventing values as fact, and spec #109 (R2, G1-G7) returns each such value to the owner individually. This is a gameplay balance number, not a routine local design choice.

## Options

### Option A: Owner supplies the value

- Behavior: the owner provides the comparison (which strengths, as a ratio in basis points), the threshold, the probability in basis points (0 to 10000) drawn only when the predicate holds, and any enemy cost (VP integer, or none) with provenance (a manual page, another high-trust source, or a stated design intent).
- Advantages: authoritative and unambiguous.
- Risks: the owner may not hold the original data; the value may not exist in the source game.
- Compatibility impact: none until authored.
- Migration impact: none (no prior state).
- Scope and effort: authoring in ticket #118 plus an ADR if the choice diverges from RTW3.

### Option B: Keep the value dormant

- Behavior: the ruleset section stays absent (or, if partially authored, the compile rejects it) so no production battle-offer behaviour depends on this value; The enemy never declines.
- Advantages: no unsourced value ships; the mechanics stay complete and tested against fixture-class values.
- Risks: the offer flow has no production effect; #118 and #119 stay blocked.
- Compatibility impact: none.
- Migration impact: none.
- Scope and effort: none.

### Option C: Admit as ADR-0213 `balance_adjustment`

- Behavior: the owner explicitly waives RTW3 fidelity for this value and admits an owner-chosen value as a labelled `balance_adjustment` ruleset constant with a recorded rationale (pattern of ADR-0223 and ADR-0239), never classed as manual. The owner chooses the predicate, threshold, probability and cost.
- Advantages: unblocks #118 while staying honest about provenance.
- Risks: a deliberate divergence from the manual; must be tuned by the balance sweep.
- Compatibility impact: none until authored; authoring moves production behaviour and goldens once, at go-live.
- Migration impact: one golden re-pin at go-live per the golden repinning procedure.
- Scope and effort: an ADR plus authoring in #118.

## Recommendation

Option B or C; the manual only supports the shape. If the owner wants a minimal rule, the owner chooses every sub-value.

Minimum owner response: Choose an option; for A or C, the comparison, threshold, probability and enemy cost.

## Work safely completed while blocked

The dormant mechanics (tickets #111 to #117) are specified and tested against labelled fixture-class values that never reach the production pack. Nothing is authored in production; #118 stays blocked on this decision.
