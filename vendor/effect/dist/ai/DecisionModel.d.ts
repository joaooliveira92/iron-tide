 * `supportsImages: true` to accept images. Otherwise, an input with images
 * fails with `AiError.InvalidUserInputError`.

 * `decide` receive them. Otherwise, a definition with a locate decision fails
 * with `AiError.InvalidUserInputError`, as does a locate decision whose path
 * holds no image.
 *
 * Providers that round each probability to `probabilityPrecision` decimal
 * places may return distributions whose sum drifts from 1 by up to half a unit
 * of the last place per label. Setting `probabilityPrecision` accepts that
