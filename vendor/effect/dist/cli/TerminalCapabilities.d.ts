 * Terminal rendering flags for the current process.
 *
 * **Details**

 * `canColor` says whether styling will be rendered rather than stored as
 * bytes. `canAnimate` says whether output is being watched, so pacing means
 * something. `canPrompt` says whether a question can be asked and answered.
 * The built-in `Command` output reads `canColor`, and fallback prompts for
 * missing flags and arguments are skipped when `canPrompt` is `false`.
 * `canAnimate` is for application code that renders its own output.

 * **When to use**
 *
 * Use when application output should share the built-in help, version, and
 * error output's answer. Provide `layer` to detect through
 * `ConfigProvider` and `Stdio`, or provide a value to override detection.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * The default is detected from the current process the first time it is
 * read, so later changes to the environment do not affect it. Without a
 * `process` global, every flag is `false`.

/**
 * Detects terminal capabilities from `Stdio` and the current `ConfigProvider`.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * `TERM=dumb` clears all three flags, because a terminal that cannot move the
 * cursor can neither animate nor redraw a prompt. Otherwise `NO_COLOR`, when
 * set to any non-empty value, disables color and wins over `FORCE_COLOR`.
 * `FORCE_COLOR` forces color even off a TTY, except for `0` and `false`, which
 * mean "not forcing". Empty variables count as unset, matching
 * `ConfigProvider.fromEnv`, so `FORCE_COLOR=` does not force color on.
 * `canPrompt` requires both standard input and standard output to be
 * terminals. A `ConfigProvider` fault is a defect, so the layer never fails.
 *
 * **Example** (NO_COLOR wins over FORCE_COLOR)
 *
 * ```ts import.meta.vitest
 * import { ConfigProvider, Effect, Stdio } from "effect"
 * import { TerminalCapabilities } from "effect/cli"
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *   const caps = yield* TerminalCapabilities.TerminalCapabilities
 *   return caps.canColor
 * }).pipe(
 *   Effect.provide(TerminalCapabilities.layer),
 *   Effect.provide(Stdio.layerTest({ stdoutIsTerminal: Effect.succeed(true) })),
 *   Effect.provideService(
 *     ConfigProvider.ConfigProvider,
 *     ConfigProvider.fromEnv({ env: { NO_COLOR: "1", FORCE_COLOR: "1" } })
 *   )
 * )
 *
 * Effect.runSync(program) // => false
 * ```
