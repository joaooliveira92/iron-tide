/**
 * Unauthenticated encryption with no integrity: compose with `Mac`.
 *
 * AES-CTR and AES-CBC with PKCS#7 padding, for protocols that pair them with a
 * MAC, such as SSH, SRTP, JWE, CMS, and Matrix. Anyone can change the
 * ciphertext without being detected, so authenticate it with `Mac`
 * (encrypt-then-MAC), or use `Aead` instead.
 *
 * The {@link Cipher} service generates keys, encrypts, and decrypts. The
 * top-level {@link key}, {@link fromCryptoKey}, and {@link toBytes} functions
 * build and export keys without a service. Both modes run on `crypto.subtle`.
 *
 * Keys are opaque. They hold either key bytes or a `CryptoKey`, display only
 * their algorithm, and compare by reference.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - Never reuse an IV with the same key. For AES-CTR a repeated counter block
 *   reveals the XOR of two plaintexts. For AES-CBC the IV must also be
 *   unpredictable.
 * - AES-CTR decryption never fails, whatever the ciphertext. AES-CBC
 *   decryption fails with one `DecryptionFailed` reason for both bad padding
 *   and a bad length, so callers cannot tell them apart. Verify a MAC before
 *   decrypting, or the error itself becomes a padding oracle.
