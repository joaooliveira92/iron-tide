/**
 * Key agreement: X25519, and ECDH on P-256, P-384 and P-521.
 *
 * The {@link KeyAgreement} service generates key pairs, derives a shared
 * secret from a private key and a peer's public key, and computes a private
 * key's public key. The top-level {@link privateKey}, {@link publicKey},
 * {@link privateKeyFromCryptoKey}, {@link publicKeyFromCryptoKey}, and
 * {@link toBytes} functions build and export keys without a service.
 *
 * Keys carry their algorithm in their type, so deriving a secret from keys on
 * different curves is a type error. The shared secret is plain bytes: pass it
 * through `Kdf` before using it as a key.
 *
 * Keys are opaque. They hold either bytes or a `CryptoKey`, display only their
 * algorithm, and compare by reference. The bytes are:
 *
 * - X25519: the 32-byte private key and the 32-byte public key;
 * - ECDH: PKCS#8 for private keys, and the uncompressed SEC1 point for public
 *   keys.
 *
 * Only X25519 private keys and X25519 and ECDH public keys have a raw
 * constructor. ECDH private keys come from
 * `KeyAgreement.generateKeyPair`, `CryptoKey`s, or key formats.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - X25519 needs Chrome 133, Firefox 130, or Safari 17. There is no fallback
 *   for older browsers.
 * - X25519 private keys are generated from `SecureRandom` bytes, so a seeded
 *   `SecureRandom` reproduces them. ECDH key generation uses WebCrypto's own
 *   randomness and cannot be seeded.
