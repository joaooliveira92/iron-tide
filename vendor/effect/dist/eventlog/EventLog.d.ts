/**
 * Runtime for writing typed events to an event journal.
 *
 * `EventLog` combines event groups, handlers, a journal, local identity,
 * optional remote replicas, and reactivity hooks. Writers send typed payloads
 * through a client; the matching handler runs first, and the journal entry is
 * committed only after the handler succeeds. This module also contains the
 * layers and helpers needed to assemble that runtime.
 *
 * **Remote compaction**
 *
 * An encrypted remote whose server sets `HelloResponse.compaction` can store a
 * compacted snapshot of its history, so a new device replays the snapshot and
 * a recent tail instead of every write. Clients build the snapshots because
 * only they can decrypt the entries.
 *
 * Only a client with a `remote: true` compactor, on a remote not built with
 * `compaction: false`, calls the compaction RPCs. It polls the status on
 * connect and about hourly. When the server wants compaction and the journal
 * has caught up, it starts a background run after a random delay of a few
 * minutes. The run reads the input, taking entries from the journal where it
 * can and fetching the rest, runs the opted-in compactors and uploads the
 * entries they keep. The server lets one run per store hold a stage and
 * answers the others `Busy`, so devices that start together download the
 * input once. `EventLog.compact` starts a run immediately, for example from
 * a worker holding the identity.
 *
 * An operator can roll back a bad snapshot on the server. The server then
 * re-appends the snapshot's input at the head, so every client, including
 * ones from before remote compaction, receives the dropped entries through
 * `changes` and skips the ones it already holds.
 *
 * Known limitations:
 *
 * - A run holds every kept entry in memory. A device with a large store can
 *   opt out with `compaction: false` and leave compaction to a device or
 *   worker with more memory.
 * - The library can't check that a compactor keeps the `remote` contract (see
 *   `groupCompaction`). The drop-only and idempotence checks catch common
 *   mistakes. A snapshot that drops too much can only be undone by a rollback
 *   before the server prunes the history.
 * - Changes to a field's meaning between schema versions aren't detected.
 *   Strict decoding only catches unknown fields.
 * - A new device still replays the newest day or so of writes, because the
 *   server only compacts data older than its lag.
 * - A client that stops partway through a run holds the server's busy claim
 *   until its stage expires.

 *
 * **When to use**
 *
 * Use when handlers project into a store with transactions, such as
 * `sql.withTransaction` or an IndexedDB transaction over the projection
 * tables, so a batch of N events commits once instead of N times.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * The journal performs no I/O while the transaction is open: it reads replay
 * conflicts before the transaction starts and commits the batch after it
 * completes. Defaults to running the handlers without a transaction.
 *
 * If the transaction fails, the journal commits nothing from the batch. For a
 * replayed batch, the remote is subscribed again after a backoff of up to 10
 * seconds and the batch is delivered again, so later batches from that remote
 * wait until it succeeds; local writes and other remotes are not blocked. A
 * local write fails with the error and is not retried.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - A replayed entry that fails to decode, or whose handler fails or dies,
 *   fails the whole batch, which is retried as above. A failure that repeats
 *   on every attempt, such as a payload written by a newer schema, stops sync
 *   from that remote until the app is updated to handle it.
 * - In a local write, an error returned by a handler fails the transaction
 *   and the write, and the journal commits none of its events.
 * - Failures that abort the underlying transaction fail the whole batch, even
 *   when the handler recovers from them. In IndexedDB, any failed request that
 *   is not prevented aborts the whole transaction, and in PostgreSQL so does a
 *   failed statement outside a savepoint.
 * - Failing the batch does not undo side effects of handlers that already ran.
 *   Only changes made inside a transaction that rolls back are undone.
 * - Replay handlers must tolerate running more than once for the same entry.
 * - Unless the transaction and the journal share a database connection, the
 *   transaction commits before the journal does, and the two commits are not
 *   atomic. A crash between them replays a remote batch on restart, but a
 *   local write is lost from the journal while its projection changes remain.
 * - An IndexedDB transaction commits once it has no pending requests and
 *   control returns to the event loop. A custom wrapper must stop the fiber
 *   from yielding to the scheduler while it is open, by providing
 *   `References.PreventSchedulerYield` as `withTransaction` from
 *   `@effect/platform-browser` does. Otherwise it can commit partway through a
 *   batch, and the remaining handlers fail.
 * - The transaction stays open for the whole batch, so other read-write
 *   transactions on the same tables wait for it.
 * - The transaction must not change the error or success of the wrapped
 *   effect. Convert its own failures into defects.

 * writes.
 *
 * **Details**

 * type, and still requires its remaining services plus `EventJournal` and
 * `Identity`.
 *

 *
 * The schema argument does not register handlers by itself. Handler registration
 * comes from the supplied layer, and writing an event without a registered
 * handler dies with `Event handler not found for: "<tag>"`.
 *
 * @see {@link schema} for creating the schema argument from event groups
 * @see {@link group} for building the handler layer consumed by this layer
 * @see {@link layerEventLog} for installing the runtime and registry without combining a handler layer
