 * and frames large change payloads into chunks.
 *
 * `Authenticate` calls `authorizeIdentity` with the claimed public key and the
 * presented signing public key, then verifies the signature against the
 * presented key. Only a verified key is passed to
 * `getOrCreateSessionAuthBinding`, and a key that differs from the identity's
 * existing binding is rejected.
 *
 * Use the connection's `ConnectionWrites.track` in `onWrite` and
 * `ConnectionWrites.filter` in `changes` to suppress its own write echoes.
 * `compaction` sets `HelloResponse.compaction`, advertising that the server
 * also serves `EventLogCompactionRpcs`.
