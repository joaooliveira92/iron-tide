 * batches.
 *

/**
 * Storage primitives for encrypted remote compaction.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * The server owns the policy: trigger threshold, lag, no-op backoff, commit
 * checks and virtual sequences. Each primitive is atomic per store.
 *
 * A store always has one active activation. Before the first commit it is the
 * originals, with base `firstSequence - 1`. `begin` opens a stage pinned to the
 * active activation and to `through`. The stage claim expires `stageTtl` after
 * begin or the latest stored Part, and `begin` takes over an expired claim.
 * Stage-scoped primitives fail with `CompactionNotFound` once the stage has
 * expired, been aborted or committed, or when it belongs to another store, so
 * a commit is answered only once.
 *
 * `stagePart` stores one segment of encrypted snapshot batches, or answers
 * `AlreadyStored` for a segment it already has. It doesn't check entry ids:
 * the server's commit checks reject repeats, and readers dedupe by id.
 * `commit` takes every staged batch's virtual
 * start sequence in position order, and activates the staged set only if the
 * pinned activation is still active.
 *
 * `rollback` reactivates the previous generation under a new activation id
 * and re-appends, at the head, the input of the stage that built the withdrawn
 * one: the previous batch set, then the originals between the two bases.
 * Clients that read the withdrawn snapshot get what it dropped through
 * `changes`. A sweep on `Clock` prunes a generation, and the originals it
 * replaced, `grace` after it was superseded or withdrawn.
