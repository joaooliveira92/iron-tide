 * (or `null`). Media types match case-insensitively. Anything else

 * `Retry-After` header (whole seconds or an HTTP date, measured from when the
 * response arrived) becomes `retryAfter`. A non-2xx GraphQL response is passed
 * to the client, which never treats it as a success: it fails with a
 * `ResponseError` when the body has `errors`, and with a `TransportError`
 * carrying the same metadata otherwise.
 *
 * A subscription is a `POST` with `Accept: text/event-stream`. Each `next`
 * event is emitted with the response headers but no status, and the stream
 * ends on a `complete` event, with or without a `data:` line. A body that
 * fails, or ends without a `complete` event, is a retryable `TransportError`

 * `subscriptionRetry` resubscribes. A non-stream answer, such as a `400` with
 * `errors`, is read like a query's response. Interrupting the stream aborts
 * the request.
 *
 * With `subscriptions: { webSocket }`, subscriptions go over graphql-ws as in
 * {@link layerWebSocket}, and the layer needs a `Socket.WebSocketConstructor`.
 *
 * To route each query, mutation and graphql-sse subscription, `url` can be a
 * function of the calling fiber's context (including the call's `context`
 * option), `kind` and `operationName`, or an `Effect<string>` with no errors
 * or requirements that runs in that context. Use a defaulted
 * `Context.Reference` to select the server. Reading a missing service with
 * `Context.get` is a defect, not a `TransportError`. Neither form can be
 * combined with `subscriptions.webSocket`: the socket URL is fixed at
 * connection time.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * `GraphQLResolver` resolves each lookup's URL once, in the calling fiber,
 * before middleware run and before the batched request exists, then sends
 * each batch to the URL it was grouped by. A single call resolves it in the
 * transport, after middleware.
 * So the URL must depend only on the context and the operation, and
 * middleware must not change `kind` or `operationName` or provide services
 * the URL reads.
 *
 * `RequestResolver.withCache` and `RequestResolver.persisted` key on the lookup,
 * not the URL, so results can leak across servers. For caching, use a separate
 * client and resolver per server, for example with `LayerMap`.

     * The HTTP transport: queries and mutations are sent as `POST` with a JSON
     * body to `url`, using the `HttpClient` in context. Subscriptions use
     * graphql-sse distinct mode on the same URL, or graphql-ws when
     * `subscriptions.webSocket` is set.
     *
     * **Details**
     *
     * With `queryMethod: "GET"` (default `"POST"`), queries are sent as `GET`
     * with no body: `query` and `operationName` become URL params, plus
     * `variables` and `extensions` as JSON when set. Mutations are always
     * `POST`, and so are `GraphQLResolver.aliased` batches. A long query is not
     * retried as `POST`.
     *
     * A request's `headers` and `urlParams`, from the call options or from
     * middleware, are applied to every HTTP request. A query string already on
     * `url` is kept. On `GET`, the request's `urlParams` come before the GraphQL
     * params, which replace any caller param with the same name.
     *
     * Every response's HTTP `status` is passed to the client as
     * `ExecutionResult.status`, and a call that fails with GraphQL `errors`
     * reports it as `ResponseError.status`. Response headers are passed the
     * same way, as `ExecutionResult.headers` and `ResponseError.headers`.
     *
     * A response is a GraphQL response when its `Content-Type` is
     * `application/graphql-response+json`, whatever the status, or when it is
     * `application/json` and the body has a list of `errors` or a `data` object
     * (or `null`). Media types match case-insensitively. Anything else
     * is a `TransportError` with the response `status` and `headers`, and a
     * `Retry-After` header (whole seconds or an HTTP date, measured from when the
     * response arrived) becomes `retryAfter`. A non-2xx GraphQL response is passed
     * to the client, which never treats it as a success: it fails with a
     * `ResponseError` when the body has `errors`, and with a `TransportError`
     * carrying the same metadata otherwise.
     *
     * A subscription is a `POST` with `Accept: text/event-stream`. Each `next`
     * event is emitted with the response headers but no status, and the stream
     * ends on a `complete` event, with or without a `data:` line. A body that
     * fails, or ends without a `complete` event, is a retryable `TransportError`
     * with a server `retry:` line as its `retryAfter`, so the client's
     * `subscriptionRetry` resubscribes. A non-stream answer, such as a `400` with
     * `errors`, is read like a query's response. Interrupting the stream aborts
     * the request.
     *
     * With `subscriptions: { webSocket }`, subscriptions go over graphql-ws as in
     * {@link layerWebSocket}, and the layer needs a `Socket.WebSocketConstructor`.
     *
     * To route each query, mutation and graphql-sse subscription, `url` can be a
     * function of the calling fiber's context (including the call's `context`
     * option), `kind` and `operationName`, or an `Effect<string>` with no errors
     * or requirements that runs in that context. Use a defaulted
     * `Context.Reference` to select the server. Reading a missing service with
     * `Context.get` is a defect, not a `TransportError`. Neither form can be
     * combined with `subscriptions.webSocket`: the socket URL is fixed at
     * connection time.
     *
     * **Gotchas**
     *
     * `GraphQLResolver` resolves each lookup's URL once, in the calling fiber,
     * before middleware run and before the batched request exists, then sends
     * each batch to the URL it was grouped by. A single call resolves it in the
     * transport, after middleware.
     * So the URL must depend only on the context and the operation, and
     * middleware must not change `kind` or `operationName` or provide services
     * the URL reads.
     *
     * `RequestResolver.withCache` and `RequestResolver.persisted` key on the lookup,
     * not the URL, so results can leak across servers. For caching, use a separate
     * client and resolver per server, for example with `LayerMap`.

/**
 * The graphql-ws transport: every operation goes over one WebSocket using the
 * `graphql-transport-ws` subprotocol, with the `Socket.WebSocketConstructor`
 * in context.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * The socket connects lazily and multiplexes operations by id. It closes after
 * `idleTimeout` (default 0) with no active operations, or with code `1000`
 * when the layer's scope closes.
 *
 * - Operations wait for `connection_ack`. `connectionAckTimeout` (default
 *   10 seconds) starts after sending `connection_init`.
 * - `connectionParams` runs on every connection, allowing token refresh.
 *   Failure or a socket close during evaluation is a `TransportError`.
 * - Handshake `headers` accept `Headers.Input` and are normalized before
 *   reaching the socket. They require a Node or Bun WebSocket constructor;
 *   browsers cannot set them. Per-operation `headers` and `urlParams` are ignored.
 * - Results carry no HTTP `status`.
 * - `keepAlive` (default 10 seconds, or `false` to disable) sends `ping`.
 *   No server frame in the following interval causes a retryable failure.
 *   Server `ping` receives `pong`.
 * - Lost connections fail every active operation with a `TransportError`
 *   carrying the close code. See `GraphQLClientError.isFatalCloseCode` for
 *   non-retryable codes. The transport never replays operations; the client
 *   retries subscriptions and the next operation reconnects.
 * - Once the layer's scope has closed, every new operation fails at once
 *   with a non-retryable `TransportError` marked `fatal`.
 * - Messages follow graphql-ws validation. Invalid messages close the socket
 *   with fatal code `4400`; valid messages for unknown ids are ignored.
 * - Server `error` messages become `ResponseError` values. Interrupting a
 *   subscription sends `complete`.
