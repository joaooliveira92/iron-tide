 * **When to use**
 *
 * Use when the app runs behind proxies that append to `X-Forwarded-For`, such
 * as most load balancers and TLS terminators.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * Headers are ignored unless the original transport peer
 * (`request.peerAddress`) is trusted. `X-Forwarded-For` is then walked from
 * the right, skipping trusted proxies. The first untrusted address becomes
 * `remoteAddress`. When every address is trusted, the leftmost one is used. An
 * entry that is not an IP address, such as `unknown`, stops the walk and
 * leaves the request unchanged.
 *
 * `X-Forwarded-Host` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` are only used when they list one
 * value per `X-Forwarded-For` entry; the value at the selected position
 * replaces the `host` header and sets `protocol` (`http` or `https`), which
 * `HttpServerRequest.toURL` uses. Otherwise the transport values are kept.
 *
 * `request.peerAddress` keeps the transport peer after `remoteAddress` is
 * replaced.

 * import { Effect, Option } from "effect"
 * import { HttpMiddleware, HttpServerRequest, HttpServerResponse } from "effect/http"

 *   })
 * )
 *
 * // The load balancer at 10.0.0.1 appended the client address to a spoofed entry
 * const request = HttpServerRequest.fromWeb(
 *   new Request("http://app.test/", { headers: { "x-forwarded-for": "6.6.6.6, 198.51.100.7" } })

 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * Content negotiation follows RFC 9110: the first algorithm in server
 * preference order that the client accepts with a positive q-value and the
 * platform supports is used. When no algorithm is acceptable the response is
 * sent uncompressed.
 *
 * The body transform is performed by the `HttpPlatform` service.
 *
 * Responses are skipped when the status is 1xx, 204, 206, or 304, when a
 * `Content-Encoding` is already present, when `Cache-Control: no-transform`
 * is set, when the content type is absent or not compressible, when a known
 * body length is below `minSize`, or when the body is empty or `FormData`. A
 * response carrying `Content-Encoding: identity` opts out of compression and
 * has the header stripped before sending.
 *
 * `Vary: Accept-Encoding` is set on every response that was eligible by
 * status and content type, including ones skipped by negotiation or
 * `minSize`.
 *
 * Do not combine this middleware with Deno's automatic response compression.
 * On edge runtimes that already apply automatic compression, the middleware
 * is unnecessary. Platforms backed by Web `CompressionStream` also cannot
 * explicitly flush each input chunk, so incremental delivery depends on the
 * runtime's implementation.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * Compression can expose secrets through BREACH-style attacks when one
 * response contains both secret data and attacker-controlled input and an
 * attacker can observe the compressed response length. For affected routes,
 * disable compression with `Content-Encoding: identity` or
 * `Cache-Control: no-transform`, or use `compressible` to restrict which

 * Middleware that decompresses request bodies sent with a `Content-Encoding`

 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * The request service is replaced with a view whose body accessors (`stream`,
 * `text`, `json`, `arrayBuffer`, `urlParamsBody`, `multipart`) yield the
 * decompressed body, and whose headers no longer include `Content-Encoding`
 * or `Content-Length`. Decompression is lazy and only happens when the body
 * is read. Stacked codings such as `deflate, gzip` are undone in reverse
 * order, and `identity` members are ignored.
 *
 * Requests whose `Content-Encoding` includes any other coding are rejected
 * with `415 Unsupported Media Type` and `Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate`,
 * without running the app. Malformed compressed data fails the body read
 * with a `RequestParseError`, or a `MultipartError` with reason `Parse` when
 * reading multipart data.
 *
 * The decompressed size is limited to `maxDecompressedSize`, falling back to
 * the `MaxBodySize` reference and then to 10 MiB. Exceeding it fails the body
 * read with a `RequestParseError`, or a `MultipartError` with reason
 * `BodyTooLarge` when reading multipart data. The limit applies to every body
 * accessor, including `stream`.
 *
 * Decompression uses the global `DecompressionStream`. `deflate` means the
 * zlib format (RFC 1950); raw deflate data is rejected.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * `request.source` is still the original, compressed request.
 * `HttpServerRequest.toWeb` returns that compressed request only when the
 * source is a Web `Request`. On other platforms, such as Node, it builds a new
 * `Request` from the decompressed body and the stripped headers.
