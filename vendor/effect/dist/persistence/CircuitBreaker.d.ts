/**
 * Keyed circuit breakers for calls to unreliable dependencies.
 *
 * A `CircuitBreaker` holds one circuit per key, so one policy can guard many
 * hosts or tenants. State lives in a `CircuitBreakerStore`: `layerStoreMemory`
 * keeps it in the process, `layerStoreRedis` shares it between processes.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * - Closed: calls run, and the trip policy decides when the circuit opens.
 * - Open: calls fail with `CircuitOpen` until the open time ends.
 * - HalfOpen: the next call is the probe, and other calls fail with
 *   `CircuitHalfOpen` while it runs. A successful probe closes the circuit and
 *   a failed one reopens it. An interrupted or `Ignored` probe frees the slot.
 * - The backoff count survives a close. It resets once the circuit has stayed
 *   closed as long as it was last open.
 * - Calls that must always run pass `onRejection: "allow"`. The circuit
 *   records them when it would admit them, and runs them unrecorded when it
 *   would refuse them, as in "Recording calls that must always run" below.
 *
 * The breaker never waits. Retry rejections outside it, as in "Retrying
 * rejections" below. Put `Effect.retry` and `Effect.timeout` inside it, so it
 * sees one outcome per call. With `ExecutionPlan`, put a breaker inside each
 * step under its own key.
 *
 * The breaker emits no metrics or spans. Observe it through `state(key)`,
 * `transitions` and the typed error.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - Use one policy per key. Breakers that share a key and a store share one
 *   circuit, and nothing checks that their policies match. Separate them with
 *   distinct keys or a Redis `prefix`.
 * - Calls admitted before a trip still run to completion, but their outcomes
 *   change nothing.
 * - "Consecutive" counts in order of completion, not of start.
 * - `state(key)` reads the shared store. `transitions` only shows what this
 *   breaker instance did.
 * - Store errors the breaker swallows (a fail-open admit, a failed record, a
 *   failed Redis lease renewal) are reported with their cause at
 *   `References.UnhandledLogLevel`. Set it to `undefined` to silence them.
 * - Cap an exponential `openDuration`, with `Schedule.upTo` or with
 *   `Schedule.min` and a `Schedule.spaced`, or it keeps growing for a
 *   dependency that flaps.
 *
 * **Example** (Rejecting calls once a circuit opens)
 *
 * ```ts import.meta.vitest
 * import { Data, Effect } from "effect"
 * import { CircuitBreaker } from "effect/persistence"
 *
 * class PaymentsError extends Data.TaggedError("PaymentsError") {}
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *   const breaker = yield* CircuitBreaker.make({
 *     tripPolicy: CircuitBreaker.consecutive(2),
 *     openDuration: "30 seconds"
 *   })
 *   const charge = Effect.fail(new PaymentsError()).pipe(
 *     breaker.execute({ key: "payments" })
 *   )
 *
 *   // Two failures in a row open the circuit.
 *   yield* Effect.flip(charge)
 *   yield* Effect.flip(charge)
 *
 *   // The third call is rejected without running.
 *   return yield* charge.pipe(
 *     Effect.catchReason("CircuitBreakerError", "CircuitOpen", (reason) => Effect.succeed(`${reason.key} is open`))
 *   )
 * }).pipe(Effect.scoped, Effect.provide(CircuitBreaker.layerStoreMemory()))
 *
 * await Effect.runPromise(program) // => "payments is open"
 * ```
 *
 * **Example** (Retrying rejections)
 *
 * For `CircuitOpen`, wait at least the rejection's `retryAfter`. For
 * `CircuitHalfOpen`, the jittered backoff keeps waiting callers from retrying
 * at the same moment. Store errors and the call's own errors are not retried.
 *
 * ```ts import.meta.vitest
 * import { Data, Duration, Effect, Ref, Schedule } from "effect"
 * import { CircuitBreaker } from "effect/persistence"
 *
 * const isRejection = (error: unknown): error is CircuitBreaker.CircuitBreakerError =>
 *   error instanceof CircuitBreaker.CircuitBreakerError && error.reason._tag !== "CircuitBreakerStoreError"
 *
 * const retryRejections = Schedule.exponential("20 millis").pipe(
 *   Schedule.jittered,
 *   Schedule.modifyDelay(({ duration, input }) =>
 *     Effect.succeed(
 *       isRejection(input) && input.reason._tag === "CircuitOpen"
 *         ? Duration.max(duration, input.reason.retryAfter)
 *         : duration
 *     )
 *   )
 * )
 *
 * class QuoteError extends Data.TaggedError("QuoteError") {}
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *   const breaker = yield* CircuitBreaker.make({
 *     tripPolicy: CircuitBreaker.consecutive(1),
 *     openDuration: "50 millis"
 *   })
 *   const healthy = yield* Ref.make(false)
 *   const quote = Effect.flatMap(Ref.get(healthy), (ok) => ok ? Effect.succeed(42) : Effect.fail(new QuoteError()))
 *
 *   // One failure opens the circuit, then the dependency recovers.
 *   yield* Effect.flip(quote.pipe(breaker.execute({ key: "quotes" })))
 *   yield* Ref.set(healthy, true)
 *
 *   // Rejected while open, then retried once the circuit lets a probe through.
 *   return yield* quote.pipe(
 *     breaker.execute({ key: "quotes" }),
 *     Effect.retry({ schedule: retryRejections, while: isRejection, times: 5 })
 *   )
 * }).pipe(Effect.scoped, Effect.provide(CircuitBreaker.layerStoreMemory()))
 *
 * await Effect.runPromise(program) // => 42
 * ```
 *
 * **Example** (Recording calls that must always run)
 *
 * The write runs even while the circuit is open, and its failures still open
 * the circuit for the reads that share the key.
 *
 * ```ts import.meta.vitest
 * import { Data, Effect } from "effect"
 * import { CircuitBreaker } from "effect/persistence"
 *
 * class LedgerError extends Data.TaggedError("LedgerError") {}
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *   const breaker = yield* CircuitBreaker.make({
 *     tripPolicy: CircuitBreaker.consecutive(1),
 *     openDuration: "30 seconds"
 *   })
 *   const write = Effect.fail(new LedgerError()).pipe(
 *     breaker.execute({ key: "ledger", onRejection: "allow" })
 *   )
 *
 *   // The first failed write opens the circuit, and the second still runs.
 *   yield* Effect.flip(write)
 *   const error = yield* Effect.flip(write)
 *   const state = yield* breaker.state("ledger")
 *   return [error._tag, state._tag]
 * }).pipe(Effect.scoped, Effect.provide(CircuitBreaker.layerStoreMemory()))
 *
 * await Effect.runPromise(program) // => ["LedgerError", "Open"]

/**
 * Service that runs effects through keyed circuits and reports their state.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * - `execute` runs the call through the circuit for `key` and records its
 *   outcome. `classify` maps the call's `Exit` to an `Outcome`, directly or as
 *   an effect. By default a success is a `Success` and any failure, defects
 *   included, is a `Failure`, since a rejected `Effect.promise` only surfaces
 *   as a defect. An exit that is only interruption is always `Ignored`.
 *   `classify` also receives `{ probe }`, which is `true` when the call is the
 *   HalfOpen probe, so an outcome it would otherwise ignore can reopen the
 *   circuit.
 *   `onRejection` decides what a call does when the circuit refuses it:
 *   `"fail"` (the default) fails it with `CircuitOpen` or `CircuitHalfOpen`,
 *   `"allow"` runs it unrecorded. An admitted call, probe included, is
 *   recorded as usual.
 * - `state` reads the shared state of a circuit.
 * - `transitions` emits this breaker's transitions and ends when its scope
 *   closes.
 *
 * **Gotchas**
 *
 * - If `classify` throws or dies, the outcome is `Ignored` and the call dies.
 * - Bound an effectful `classify` with `Effect.timeoutOrElse` or
 *   `Effect.timeoutOption`, since `Effect.timeout` adds a typed error. A call
 *   to the same key from inside `classify` is rejected while its call is the
 *   probe.
 *
 * **Example** (Timing out calls inside the breaker)
 *
 * A timeout inside the breaker counts as a `Failure`. Outside, it interrupts
 * the call, which is `Ignored`.
 *
 * ```ts import.meta.vitest
 * import { Effect } from "effect"
 * import { CircuitBreaker } from "effect/persistence"
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *   const breaker = yield* CircuitBreaker.make({
 *     tripPolicy: CircuitBreaker.consecutive(1),
 *     openDuration: "1 minute"
 *   })
 *
 *   yield* Effect.never.pipe(
 *     Effect.timeout("10 millis"),
 *     breaker.execute({ key: "inside" }),
 *     Effect.ignore
 *   )
 *   yield* Effect.never.pipe(
 *     breaker.execute({ key: "outside" }),
 *     Effect.timeout("10 millis"),
 *     Effect.ignore
 *   )
 *
 *   const inside = yield* breaker.state("inside")

 *   return [inside._tag, outside._tag]
 * }).pipe(Effect.scoped, Effect.provide(CircuitBreaker.layerStoreMemory()))
 *
 * await Effect.runPromise(program) // => ["Open", "Closed"]
 * ```
 *
 * **Example** (Retrying inside the breaker)
 *
 * The breaker sees one outcome per call, so a call a retry rescued counts as
 * one `Success`.
 *
 * ```ts import.meta.vitest
 * import { Data, Effect, Ref, Schedule } from "effect"
 * import { CircuitBreaker } from "effect/persistence"
 *
 * class InventoryError extends Data.TaggedError("InventoryError") {}
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *   const breaker = yield* CircuitBreaker.make({
 *     tripPolicy: CircuitBreaker.consecutive(1),
 *     openDuration: "1 minute"
 *   })
 *   const attempts = yield* Ref.make(0)
 *   // Fails twice, then succeeds.
 *   const stock = Effect.flatMap(
 *     Ref.updateAndGet(attempts, (n) => n + 1),
 *     (n) => n <= 2 ? Effect.fail(new InventoryError()) : Effect.succeed(7)
 *   )
 *
 *   const result = yield* stock.pipe(
 *     Effect.retry({ schedule: Schedule.exponential("1 millis"), times: 3 }),
 *     breaker.execute({ key: "inventory" })
 *   )
 *   const state = yield* breaker.state("inventory")
 *   return [result, state._tag]
 * }).pipe(Effect.scoped, Effect.provide(CircuitBreaker.layerStoreMemory()))
 *
 * await Effect.runPromise(program) // => [7, "Closed"]
 * ```
 *
 * **Example** (Falling back to another provider with ExecutionPlan)
 *
 * Each provider guards its calls under its own key, so once the primary's
 * circuit opens its step fails fast and the plan moves to the fallback.
 *
 * ```ts import.meta.vitest
 * import { Context, Data, Effect, ExecutionPlan, Layer } from "effect"
 * import { CircuitBreaker } from "effect/persistence"
 *
 * class GeocoderError extends Data.TaggedError("GeocoderError") {}
 *
 * class Geocoder extends Context.Service<Geocoder, {
 *   readonly lookup: (address: string) => Effect.Effect<string, GeocoderError | CircuitBreaker.CircuitBreakerError>
 * }>()("app/Geocoder") {}
 *
 * const provider = (name: string, lookup: (address: string) => Effect.Effect<string, GeocoderError>) =>
 *   Layer.effect(
 *     Geocoder,
 *     Effect.gen(function*() {
 *       const breaker = yield* CircuitBreaker.CircuitBreaker
 *       return Geocoder.of({
 *         lookup: (address) => lookup(address).pipe(breaker.execute({ key: `geocoder:${name}` }))
 *       })
 *     })
 *   )
 *
 * const Primary = provider("primary", () => Effect.fail(new GeocoderError()))
 * const Fallback = provider("fallback", (address) => Effect.succeed(`${address} (fallback)`))
 *
 * const plan = ExecutionPlan.make({ provide: Primary }, { provide: Fallback })
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function*() {
 *   const geocoder = yield* Geocoder
 *   return yield* geocoder.lookup("1 Main St")
 * }).pipe(
 *   Effect.withExecutionPlan(plan),
 *   Effect.provide(

 *
 * **Example** (Counting transitions)
 *
 * Label by `from` and `to`, not `key`, to keep the number of series fixed.
 *
 * ```ts import.meta.vitest
 * import { Effect, Metric, Stream } from "effect"
 * import { CircuitBreaker } from "effect/persistence"
 *
 * const transitionsTotal = Metric.counter("circuit_breaker_transitions_total", { incremental: true })
 *
 * const countTransitions = (breaker: CircuitBreaker.CircuitBreaker) =>
 *   breaker.transitions.pipe(
 *     Stream.runForEach((transition) =>

/**
 * Creates a `CircuitBreaker` from the current `CircuitBreakerStore`.
 *
 * **Details**
 *
 * - `tripPolicy` decides when a Closed circuit opens.
 * - `openDuration` is a duration or a `Schedule`. The n-th consecutive opening
 *   lasts the schedule's n-th delay, and the last delay repeats once the
 *   schedule ends. Elapsed-time combinators such as `upTo` and `during`
 *   measure the time spent open, not wall time. Schedules that read the
 *   current date, such as `cron`, are not supported.
 * - `maxOpenDuration` (default one hour) caps a `Retry-After` hint. It never
 *   caps `openDuration`.
 * - `onStoreError` decides what a call does when the store cannot admit it:
 *   `"allow"` (the default) runs it unrecorded, `"fail"` fails it with
 *   `CircuitBreakerStoreError`.
 *

 *
 * - Each circuit is one hash at `${prefix}${key}`, and `prefix` defaults to

 * - The probe holds a lease of `probeLease` (default 10 seconds), renewed

 *   probe's outcome is discarded.
 * - `idleTimeToLive` (default one hour) expires idle keys. An Open key, or one

 *   lease, so expiry never cuts a probe short or resets the backoff early. An
 *   expired key starts again as Closed with a backoff count of 0.
