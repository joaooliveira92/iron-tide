     *
     * **Details**
     *
     * Inside the transaction, `Reactivity.invalidate` and `Reactivity.mutation`
     * invalidate once the outermost transaction commits, and not at all if it
     * rolls back.
     *
     * To start a top-level transaction with a statement other than the
     * client's, such as one that sets its isolation level, provide
     * `BeginTransaction`.
     *
     * To retry serialization failures or deadlocks, wrap the outermost
     * `withTransaction` in `Effect.retry`. Each attempt starts a fresh
     * transaction and re-runs the whole effect, including `COMMIT`.
     *
     * **Gotchas**
     *
     * Deferred invalidations run individually after the commit and don't join an
     * enclosing `Reactivity.withBatch`. Only the `Reactivity` service read from
     * the transaction's context defers, and a fiber that outlives the
     * transaction can't defer through it, as with `afterCommit`. Transactions
     * that don't go through `makeWithTransaction` invalidate immediately.
     *
     * Retrying a nested transaction only retries its savepoint, which can't
     * recover an outer transaction the database has aborted. Since a retried
     * effect runs more than once, keep non-transactional side effects in
     * `afterCommit`, which discards the callbacks of a failed attempt but
     * doesn't guarantee they run exactly once. Don't retry `ConnectionError`: a
     * `COMMIT` that lost its connection may have committed, and retrying would
     * apply its writes twice.
     *
     * **Example** (Retrying serialization failures and deadlocks)
     *
     * ```ts
     * import { Effect, Schedule } from "effect"
     * import { SqlClient } from "effect/sql"

     *     Effect.retry({
     *       while: (error) => error.reason._tag === "SerializationError" || error.reason._tag === "DeadlockError",
     *       times: 5,
     *       schedule: Schedule.exponential("10 millis").pipe(Schedule.jittered)

     *
     * A callback runs with the services that were in scope when it was
     * registered, minus this client's transaction, so a callback that queries

     *
     * **Gotchas**
     *
     * Callbacks are lost if the process exits before they run or the outcome of
     * `COMMIT` is unknown, so work that must happen belongs in a table written
     * in the same transaction. After `COMMIT`, callbacks run uninterruptibly,
     * even if the fiber was interrupted or releasing the connection failed, and
     * `withTransaction` waits for them, so keep them short and fork
     * long-running work.
     * Registering after the transaction has ended is a defect.
